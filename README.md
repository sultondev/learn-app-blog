# Hello my name is Sultankhan.

### I started this project for many reasons.

- I want to create a blog website which will be used by the young and adult Uzbek community.

- I really enjoy reading articles on [medium.com](<https://medium.com>)

- I regret that many young Uzbek teenagers and adults don't know about medium and can't read.

- Medium is a very fantastic spot to learn from others' experiences.

- Also I want to learn several technologies.

***

## !!! This project is open-source you can write your thoughts and advice me



### The technology stack:

- React JS
- Recoil JS
- TypeScript
- Firebase
- Formik
- Tailwindcss
- Material UI
